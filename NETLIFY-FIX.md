## Deploy Steps

### 1. Push Updated Code to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove Socket.IO dependency for static deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Trigger Netlify Redeploy
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Click on your site: `technest-intern-task-chat-application`
- Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"
- Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

### 3. Test the Fixed Site
Your site should now work at: `https://technest-intern-task-chat-application.netlify.app`

## What Works Now âœ…
- âœ… No more Socket.IO errors
- âœ… Chat interface loads properly
- âœ… Demo mode with simulated messages
- âœ… All UI features work
- âœ… Verification system (using Netlify functions)
- âœ… Report system (using Netlify functions)

## Demo Features
- Users can join chat rooms
- Messages are echoed back locally (demo simulation)
- All modals and UI interactions work

## Production Note
For a full real-time chat with multiple users, you'd need:
- A Socket.IO server (like on Railway, Heroku, or AWS)
- Database for message persistence
- Real WebSocket connections

The current deployment is perfect as a **portfolio demo** showing your frontend skills and design!
